# Introduction 

The study of optimal control began with a challenge by Johann Bernoulli. 
In simple terms, the challenge was to find the path from point A to point B, 
in a vertical plane, such that a moveable point M will take in the shortest 
amount of time if moved purely under the influence of its own weight 
[@sussmann1997300].
